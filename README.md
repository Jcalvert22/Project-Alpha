# This is the Project-alpha website project for CIS-376. The site is a setup like a resume. It includes an about me section, a list of resources, and placeholders for our future projects that will be updated as they are completed.
# Page Map:
# Home: About Me and introduction. Blog: My certifications and school background. Projects: A display of my future projects. Resources: Links and references for web development.
# How to View: https://jcalvert22.github.io/Project-Alpha/
# Code snippet: '<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"> <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">Jace's Developer Page</a></nav>' This creates my navigation bar that appears on every page on the website.
# Credit/Disclosure: This project was created by Jace Calvert. I mostly used W3Schools to code a lot of materials. Additional tools: Bootstrap(layout), Github pages(deployment), Github Copilot (help cleaning up code)
